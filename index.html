<h1>Self-Exploration</h1>
<body>
  <li>
       <p>The day I met myself</p>
       <p>I was mature enough to know what I was</p>
       <p>I was just an ordinary person to others</p>
       <p>But,I was much more than that</p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p>In 10th,I found my emotional side</p>
       <p>But,This time I wasn't much lone</p>
       <p>There were bunch of advices</p>
       <p>I heard em'all,But did what was inevitable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p>I have currently wasted half of the year</p>
       <p>And clearly not interested to do more</p>
       <p>I have been lone at most emotional phases of my life till now</p>
       <p>Now,I am just able to handle myself on my own</p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p>The rest of the year is my time</p>
       <p>I am ready to destroy myself for the sake of self satisfaction</p>
       <p>The only thing that matters to me now, is my ego,self-respect and satisfaction</p>
       <p>I just don't care what it would cost me</p>
  </li>
  <li>
       <p>At Last I Would Just Say</p>
